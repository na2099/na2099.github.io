A website that showcases all my projects, skills attained, hobbies and interests. I self-taught myself HTML and CSS to customize this website. 
The template used for this website was obtained from Massively by HTML5 UP.
Note that the website is still a work in progress.

This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)
